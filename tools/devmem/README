Purpose:

A simple library to operate physical address in usersapce,
which is based on linux "/dev/mem".

Also, some useful tools is provided, including:
--devmd, display PA's value.
--devmcpy, copy from src PA to dst PA.
--devmset, set PA to special value.
--devmload, load file to PA.
--devmsave, save PA to file.

Uasge:

--devmem library
	Include devmem.h, and put devmem.c together with your souece code,
	call the APIs you need, and build them.

--devmd 
	./devmd { address } [type] [count]
	address: Address to act upon
	width:	Width (8/16/...), default is 32
	count:	Data count to be read, default is 1

--devmcpy 
	./devmcpy {src_addr} {dst_addr} {count} [width]
	src_addr:	source address
	dst_addr:	destination address
	count:		copy count, default is 1
	width:		width, 8/16/32/64..., default is 32

--devmset 
	./devmset {address} {value} {count} [width]
	address:	Address to act upon
	value:		Value to write
	count:		Set counts
	width:		width, 8/16/32/64..., default is 32

--devmload 
	./devmload {addr} {filename}
	addr:		destination physical address
	filename:	file name will load from

--devmsave 
	./devmsave {addr} {len} {filename}
	addr:	physical address need to save
	len:	length in byte
	filename: file save to
